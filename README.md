## <center> Prescriptify </center> <br> <center> (A personal prescription management and reminder system)

The aim of this project is to design an application that implements a system to store a user's doctor's
prescription and keep track of dosage and time of consumption throughout the day.
This application is also designed to remind the user when and what medicine to consume with convenient pop-up messages. 
<br>
<br> The application is mainly designed for, but not limited to:
- **Patients with a large number of medicines to consume throughout the day.**
- **Patients with memory impairment.** 
- **Senior citizens.**

This project particularly appealed to me because I have seen my grandparents at home often forget to take their 
medicines on time. Hence, I wanted to design something convenient and useful that would allow them and 
many others to take care of their health and maintain a routine of taking medicines prescribed by their doctors on time.
